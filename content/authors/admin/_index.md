## About Me

I'm Pablo Ariño Fernández, a MSc student in Machine Learning at UCL. After my master's, I plan to pursue a PhD. My research interests include Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning. My long term goal is to contribute to solving some of the most challenging problems in AI today: How to make Deep Learning models capable of generalizing out-of-distribution and learn continually.
